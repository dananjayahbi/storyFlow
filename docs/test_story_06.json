      "text_content": "Haruki Setsuko was eighty-three years old and she had two gardens. One grew in the clay soil behind her house in Kamakura, where the hydrangeas bloomed blue because the earth was acidic and the rain came sideways off the Pacific. The other grew somewhere she couldn't explain — and she'd stopped trying decades ago.",
      "image_prompt": "Wide establishing shot of an elderly Japanese woman kneeling in a lush traditional garden behind a weathered wooden house in Kamakura, blue hydrangeas in the foreground, the Pacific Ocean visible beyond the rooftops, soft overcast light filtering through a canopy of maple branches, serene and timeless atmosphere, Studio Ghibli-inspired naturalism with photorealistic detail"
    },
    {
      "text_content": "The second garden had appeared the morning after her husband Yoshi died — thirty years ago this autumn. She'd walked out to prune the camellias and found the air shimmering between the stone lantern and the moss bank, like heat rising from summer asphalt, except it was February and her breath still made clouds.",
      "image_prompt": "A shimmer of distorted air between a stone Japanese lantern and a moss-covered bank in a winter garden, the distortion resembling a vertical heat haze but surrounded by cold breath vapor, frost on the ground, an elderly woman's silhouette approaching cautiously, mysterious and ethereal lighting, soft morning light diffused through bare branches, magical realism aesthetic"
    },
    {
      "text_content": "She stepped through it the way you step into a cold lake — all at once, because hesitation makes it worse. On the other side was the same garden, but not. The hydrangeas were pink instead of blue. The maple grew on the wrong side of the path. And sitting on the engawa, drinking tea from her favorite cup, was Yoshi. He looked up and said, 'You're late. The chrysanthemums need water.'",
      "image_prompt": "A mirror version of the Japanese garden with pink hydrangeas instead of blue, the maple tree on the opposite side, an elderly Japanese man sitting on a wooden engawa porch holding a tea cup and smiling gently, warm golden light suffusing everything, the garden lush and slightly different from the first, dreamlike soft focus on the edges of the frame, intimate and emotionally warm composition"
    },
    {
      "text_content": "She learned the rules through trial and error, the way you learn anything worth knowing. She could carry seeds across but not cut flowers. Water from one world wouldn't nourish plants in the other. And time moved strangely — an afternoon there might cost her a morning here, or sometimes nothing at all. The shimmer didn't care about consistency.",
      "image_prompt": "Setsuko's hands carefully carrying small seeds through a shimmering vertical portal between two garden realities, one side cool blue-toned with blue hydrangeas, the other warm gold-toned with pink ones, the seeds glowing faintly as they pass through the threshold, close-up with both worlds visible, surreal botanical illustration meets cinematic photography"

    {
      "text_content": "But this much was reliable: whatever she planted on one side would bloom on the other. A peony rooted in Kamakura clay would push through the soil of that other place three days later. It was the most beautiful form of correspondence she'd ever known — slower than letters, more honest than words. She'd plant wisteria here. He'd find it there. He'd plant evening primrose there. She'd wake to find it here, opening in the dark.",
      "image_prompt": "Split-screen composition showing the same garden bed from both sides of the shimmer: on the left, Setsuko planting wisteria seeds in blue-toned soil, on the right, the same spot three days later with wisteria sprouting in warm-toned light with Yoshi's hand gently touching the new growth, connected by a luminous vertical dividing line, botanical detail and emotional warmth, symmetrical composition"
    },
    {
      "text_content": "For thirty years, this was enough. Two gardens breathing in tandem across whatever membrane separated them. Setsuko grew old in both places at once, her knees aching equally on either side of the shimmer. Yoshi never aged past sixty-two. She asked him about it once, and he said, 'Time is different when you're waiting for someone. It forgets to count.'",
      "image_prompt": "Setsuko and Yoshi sitting together on the engawa in the warm-toned garden, she visibly elderly with white hair, he still appearing sixty-two, both looking out at the garden with green tea between them, autumn leaves falling slowly, the scene tender and bittersweet, late afternoon light stretching their shadows long, intimate portrait composition with soft bokeh background"
    },
    {
      "text_content": "The withering started with the moss. Setsuko noticed it on a Wednesday in her Kamakura garden — the velvet green patches turning the color of old paper, curling at the edges like they were trying to retreat into the earth. By Friday, the same thing was happening on the other side. Yoshi knelt beside a dying fern and looked up at her with an expression she recognized. It was the face he'd made the morning the doctor gave them the word 'terminal.'",
      "image_prompt": "Close-up of dying moss on garden stones, the green turning to brittle brown and curling away from the rock surface, Setsuko's aged hands reaching down to touch it, a withered fern visible nearby, the light shifting from warm to a sickly pale tone, decay beginning to spread through the garden, melancholic and foreboding atmosphere, macro photography detail with wider context"
    },
    {
      "text_content": "It spread outward like a slow exhale. The camellias dropped their petals in both worlds simultaneously — she could hear them falling in stereo if she stood near the shimmer. The wisteria turned brittle. The evening primrose stopped opening. Whatever force had sustained this impossible garden was withdrawing, and it was taking everything beautiful with it.",
      "image_prompt": "Dramatic wide shot of both gardens visible through the weakening shimmer, petals falling simultaneously on both sides like twin snowfalls, the plants withering in parallel, the shimmer itself flickering and unstable, camellia petals caught mid-fall in both realities, fading color draining from the scene, visual metaphor of loss, cinematic slow-motion feeling captured in a still image"
    },
    {
      "text_content": "Yoshi explained it the way he explained everything — simply, without decoration. The shimmer was closing. It had enough strength left for one garden, not two. She could seal it from her side and save the Kamakura garden, letting his world fade. Or she could cross over for good, save his garden, and leave her world with nothing but an empty yard and a missing old woman.",
      "image_prompt": "Yoshi and Setsuko standing on opposite sides of the dimming shimmer, facing each other, the portal barely translucent now, her garden withering behind her, his garden withering behind him, both their expressions grave and knowing, the light between them guttering like a candle in wind, emotional tension, medium two-shot through the failing portal, muted colors"
    },
    {
      "text_content": "She thought about it for six days. She watered the dying plants on both sides with equal care, which she knew was irrational. She called her daughter in Osaka, who thought her mother was simply old and lonely and talking about metaphors for grief. She wasn't. The garden was as real as anything. More real, maybe, because it had never pretended to be permanent.",
      "image_prompt": "Setsuko alone in her Kamakura kitchen, phone pressed to her ear, looking out through the window at the dying garden, her reflection ghostly in the glass, a cup of untouched tea on the counter, late evening blue light outside, warm incandescent light inside creating a boundary between worlds even here, contemplative solitude, cinematic framing with the window as a secondary portal"
    },
    {
      "text_content": "On the seventh morning, she put on the good cardigan — the indigo one Yoshi had bought her in Kyoto the year before he got sick. She brewed two cups of sencha. She carried them both through the shimmer, which was now so thin it felt like walking through a cobweb. She handed Yoshi his tea, sat down beside him on the engawa, and said, 'Let it close. Let them both go. I didn't come here for the garden.'",
      "image_prompt": "Setsuko stepping through the paper-thin shimmer carrying two cups of green tea, wearing an indigo cardigan, the portal barely visible as a faint iridescent line in the air, Yoshi waiting on the engawa with his hand extended, both gardens fading to gentle white around the edges, the couple the only point of sharp focus, profoundly emotional, warm golden light concentrated on the two figures, everything else dissolving into luminous mist"
