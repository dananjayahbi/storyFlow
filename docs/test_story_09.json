      "text_content": "In the summer of 1971, a quiet basement corridor at Stanford University was transformed into a mock prison. Psychologist Philip Zimbardo wanted to answer a deceptively simple question: what happens when you give ordinary people extraordinary power over others? The answer would shock the world — and haunt psychology for decades.",
      "image_prompt": "A dimly lit university basement corridor converted into a prison setting, 1970s aesthetic, fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows on bare concrete walls, steel bars installed across doorways, an eerie sense of institutional authority, cinematic documentary style, desaturated color palette with cold blue tones."

    {
      "text_content": "Zimbardo recruited twenty-four male college students — all screened to be psychologically healthy, stable, and average in every measurable way. These weren't troubled kids. They were the most normal young men the researchers could find. Then, with a coin flip, half were randomly assigned to be guards and half to be prisoners. That randomness is the key to everything that followed.",
      "image_prompt": "A group of clean-cut 1970s college students sitting in a bright university office, filling out psychological questionnaires, looking relaxed and ordinary, a researcher flipping a coin in the foreground, split lighting symbolizing the two fates awaiting them, warm natural tones contrasting with the clinical setting."

    {
      "text_content": "The prisoners were arrested at their homes by real Palo Alto police officers — booked, blindfolded, and stripped. They were given smocks with ID numbers, a chain locked around one ankle. The guards received khaki uniforms, mirrored sunglasses to prevent eye contact, and wooden batons. No one was told how to behave. The experiment was simply: live in this prison. Let's see what happens.",
      "image_prompt": "A dramatic scene of a young man being handcuffed at his front door by uniformed police officers in a 1970s suburban neighborhood, neighbors watching in confusion, the young man looking stunned, documentary-style cinematography with shallow depth of field, morning sunlight creating long shadows."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "Within thirty-six hours, the transformation began. Guards started waking prisoners at 2 AM for arbitrary roll calls. They forced inmates to do push-ups as punishment, revoked mattress privileges, and made prisoners clean toilets with their bare hands. Remember — these were college students who had been strangers just two days earlier. The uniform and the role were doing something to their minds.",
      "image_prompt": "A tense nighttime scene inside the mock prison, a guard in khaki uniform and reflective sunglasses standing over kneeling prisoners in numbered smocks during a forced roll call, harsh overhead fluorescent lighting, expressions of dominance and submission, high contrast shadows, photojournalistic documentary style."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "By day three, a full-scale prisoner rebellion erupted. Inmates barricaded their cells with beds. The guards crushed it — and then something darker emerged. They began using psychological tactics no one taught them: isolating ringleaders, turning prisoners against each other, creating a 'privilege cell' to break solidarity. They invented cruelty spontaneously, as if the role itself was a script they already knew.",
      "image_prompt": "A chaotic scene of prisoners pushing beds against cell doors while guards in mirrored sunglasses coordinate a response in the narrow corridor, torn bedsheets and overturned furniture, dramatic low-angle shot emphasizing the power struggle, gritty documentary lighting with motion blur suggesting urgency and violence."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "One prisoner, known only as Prisoner 8612, began screaming, crying uncontrollably, and showing signs of a genuine emotional breakdown — just 36 hours in. Zimbardo's team initially thought he was faking it to get released. When they finally let him go, his departure didn't liberate the others. It terrified them. The prison had become real in their minds.",
      "image_prompt": "A close-up portrait of a distressed young man in a numbered prison smock, tears streaming down his face, gripping the bars of a makeshift cell, his expression a mixture of rage and despair, stark dramatic lighting from a single overhead bulb, shallow depth of field blurring the dark corridor behind him."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "Here's what makes this experiment so disturbing: the guards weren't all the same. About a third remained fair. Another third were strict but not abusive. But one third — roughly three out of eleven — became genuinely sadistic. They volunteered for extra shifts. They seemed to enjoy the power. And no personality test beforehand could have predicted which ones would cross that line.",
      "image_prompt": "A stylized split-screen infographic showing three silhouettes of guards: one standing neutrally, one standing rigidly at attention, and one leaning aggressively over a cowering figure, each section tinted differently — blue for passive, yellow for strict, red for sadistic — clean documentary graphic design with bold typography showing the one-third proportions."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "Zimbardo himself was not immune. As the 'prison superintendent,' he found himself prioritizing the smooth running of his institution over the welfare of his participants. When parents visited and complained about their sons' condition, he worried about a 'prison break' — not about ethics. The situation had consumed even the person who designed it.",
      "image_prompt": "Philip Zimbardo sitting at a desk surrounded by monitoring equipment and tape recorders in a 1970s office, looking intensely at surveillance footage, papers scattered around him, his expression showing someone deeply absorbed and losing perspective, warm incandescent lighting mixing with the cold glow of a monitor, portrait-style documentary composition."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "It took an outsider to end it. Christina Maslach, a recent Stanford PhD and Zimbardo's girlfriend, visited the experiment on day five. She watched guards marching prisoners to the bathroom with bags over their heads — and she was horrified. She told Zimbardo: 'What you're doing to those boys is terrible.' Of the fifty outside observers who saw the experiment, she was the only one who objected.",
      "image_prompt": "A young woman with a shocked and disturbed expression standing at the end of a basement corridor, watching a line of prisoners with paper bags over their heads being escorted by guards, her hand raised to her mouth in horror, split lighting — warm light on her face versus cold institutional light in the corridor, cinematic documentary framing."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "The experiment was terminated on day six — eight days early. When Zimbardo announced it was over, the prisoners wept with relief. The guards, strangely, seemed disappointed. Some had to be told explicitly to stop. The entire arc — from normal college students to abusive authoritarian figures — had taken less than a week.",
      "image_prompt": "A wide shot of the mock prison corridor with cell doors open, prisoners in smocks embracing each other with visible relief, guards standing awkwardly to the side removing their sunglasses, a mix of emotions — liberation and disorientation, natural light flooding in from an open door at the end of the hallway, documentary-style composition suggesting the end of an ordeal."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "Zimbardo's conclusion became one of psychology's most cited ideas: the Lucifer Effect. It's the theory that evil isn't primarily about bad people — it's about bad situations. Put ordinary individuals into a system with unchecked power, dehumanizing conditions, and diffused responsibility, and cruelty doesn't just become possible. It becomes probable.",
      "image_prompt": "A powerful conceptual image of a normal person's silhouette standing at the center, surrounded by concentric rings representing situational forces — labeled arrows pointing inward reading 'authority,' 'anonymity,' 'dehumanization,' 'conformity,' 'diffused responsibility' — dark atmospheric background with dramatic red and amber lighting, styled as an elegant educational infographic."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "But here's the controversy. Critics like Peter Gray and Alex Haslam have argued that Zimbardo's guards weren't just responding to the situation — they were guided by it. Zimbardo's briefing told guards to create a sense of powerlessness. Recordings reveal experimenters coaching participants. Was this a study of human nature, or a self-fulfilling prophecy? The debate rages to this day.",
      "image_prompt": "A split composition showing two opposing viewpoints: on the left, Zimbardo at a podium presenting his findings with conviction, on the right, skeptical researchers examining documents and audio tapes with magnifying glasses, a crack running down the center dividing the image, muted academic tones with dramatic side lighting, documentary debate style."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "The Stanford Prison Experiment could never be replicated today — it would violate every modern research ethics standard. No informed consent about the severity. No right to withdraw freely. No protection from psychological harm. Ironically, the experiment's greatest legacy might not be what it taught us about evil — but what it forced us to demand about how we treat research subjects.",
      "image_prompt": "A modern university ethics review board meeting room, diverse committee members reviewing documents stamped with 'REJECTED' in red, a projected slide showing the Stanford Prison Experiment timeline behind them, clean contemporary lighting, professional institutional setting, conveying the gravity and formality of modern research ethics oversight."
    },
    {
      "text_content": "So what do we take from all this? Maybe the most unsettling lesson of the Stanford Prison Experiment isn't that some people are capable of cruelty. It's that most of us are — given the right costume, the right permission, and the right system. The line between good and evil doesn't run between people. It runs through every human heart. And that knowledge — uncomfortable as it is — might be the best defense we have.",
      "image_prompt": "A contemplative final image: a single mirrored sunglasses lens lying on a concrete floor, reflecting the face of a normal, thoughtful young person looking down at it, the reflection showing both the viewer and the prison corridor behind them, moody cinematic lighting with a narrow depth of field, symbolizing self-reflection on the nature of human behavior, documentary closing shot aesthetic."
